I'm Ben Sekulowicz-Barclay and Llama Studio is my little design agency. I'm a UX designer, which really means I work with organisations to create successful digital services and products by helping them understand what their users really want or need. Over the last fifteen years Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to do this&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;on multiple continents&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;for musicians, bands, start-ups, government departments and Fortune 500 companies.
