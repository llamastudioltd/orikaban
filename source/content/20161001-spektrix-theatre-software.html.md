Spektrix provide their eponymous software to over 250 arts organisations in the UK and North America. It is used by more than five thousand box-office, marketing and fundraising professionals every day. Between 2014 and 2016, I helped Spektrix to refactor their information architecture and implement a new user interface that was modern, more useable and more relevant to the way arts organisations function.

- **I uncovered and shared insights** on how arts organisations function and the problems their staff face. I was the domain expert for the wider engineering team.
- **I created site maps and user flows** based on my understanding of how arts organisations are structured and how the system is currently used.
- **I designed templates, navigation systems and pattern libraries** using my understanding of usersâ€™ frustrations and my knowledge of best practices.
- **I built and tested interactive prototypes** with clients and our customer support team to test our assumptions at every step.
- **I created a component-based style guide**, introducing the concept of components and pattern libraries to the engineering team.
- **I developed a tone of voice guide**, working with the sales, marketing and support teams to ensure we always spoke to our users with the same personality.
- **I led the project throughout**, implementing new processes and tools and educating the wider business on what we were doing and why it would benefit the company and our clients.
