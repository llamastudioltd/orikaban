Find my past was the first company in the world to put the complete birth, marriage, and death indexes for England and Wales online, and they now provide over 4 billion searchable records available. In 2014 I helped them redesign their membership and payment models.

- **I interviewed users and ran workshops** to learn how people derived value from the service and understand when and how they made the decision to sign up and spend money.
- **I created posters and presentations** for the board and senior management team, sharing our learning on how their customers wanted to use and pay for their service.
- **I mapped user journeys and created wireframes** outlining the key findings we had uncovered, working with their creative director and design team to incorporate them directly into their new visual language.
