Spotlight began collating and distributing the details of theatre and film performers in 1927, and have since grown to provide a range of services to upcoming and established performers, casting agents and producers. In 2014 I designed their new online casting service, helping casting agents to run, film and share castings from any location in the world.

- **I uncovered and shared insights on how castings are created and run**. I worked with casting agents, directors and videographers to understand and observe every stage of a casting’s lifecycle.
- **I mapped user journeys and developed personas**. I created artefacts to help me distill what I had learned and disseminate it throughout the wider project team.
- **I designed interfaces for online and native versions of the application**, including new models for file synchronisation and file sharing based on the unique requirements of remotely run castings.
- **I built and tested interactive prototypes** to refine and iterate on our solution. I worked through real castings using our prototypes with casting agents, directors and the Spotlight’s videographers.
